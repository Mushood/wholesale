## The inspiration
I recently travelled to China Yiwu International Trade City to explore the commodities market. This project is aimed to solve several issues that I faced, or saw the shop owners face when trying to do business in an international environment. Some are the issues were:
- No website for their products
- Difficulty in communication since the spoken language of the shop owners was mandarin
- No product catalogue. Pictures were usually shared by WeChat
- All quotations and orders had to be done by hand
- No proper tracking of their orders
- No clear information about the market online

I am also using this project to demonstrate my skills as a Laravel/VueJS/Sass Developer as well as deploying the site on a live server.
